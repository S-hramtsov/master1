# Quicksort algorithm

## Step-by-step description of the operation of the quick sort algorithm
1. Select a reference element from the array. Usually the reference element is the middle element.
2. Divide the array into two sub arrays: elements smaller than the reference and elements larger than the reference.
3. Recursively apply sorting to two sub arrays.

# File writer

1. Create the "Person" class by filling it with the necessary data (fields) and adding the "set and get" methods to them.
2. Create the "Validation" class to check the correctness of the input data.
3. The "ScannerPerson" class is necessary for us to receive the data entered from the user,
4. The "FileWriter" class assigns a name similar to the user's name to a file,
   creates a file with the extension ".txt" and fills it in line by line.

# Reading and Writing

1. In the parameters of the "try" block, read the file ""test_data.txt " by buffering and writing data to a new file "result_data.txt ".
2. In the body of the "try" block, we set a cycle for reading and splitting into an array of data from a file.
3. In the body of the "while" loop, we set the "if" conditions and pass the parameters for capturing data according to the specified parameters, and write them to a new file
4. in the "catch" block, we process the exception thrown from the "try" block
